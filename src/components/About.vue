                The options are seemingly endless; Iâ€™ve lived here for months and am still finding no need for looking up new restaurants and types of cuisine to enjoy!

                Kampala has no shortage of amazing coffee shops, but a couple stand out for their drinks and atmosphere.
                If you are in the city centre, check out 1000 Cups Coffee just across from the Buganda Road Craft Market.
                This coffee shop serves up beans from across the East African region and their outdoor seating area is decorated with
                traditional masks.
